The problem that I have identified from that data is the same problem that I initially had, which was determining what was important about the data. I had to go through a few iterations of uninteresting and unimportant charts before I started to be able to visualize the data in a way that could answer my research question. It took a lot of time, and wasn&rsquo;t very efficient. So the problem my data could solve is &ldquo;Deciding where to move in the USA&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Winnowing</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data I am using comes from: </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/average-cost-living-by-state/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1618006142201000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZlJN-bkZ1_mokc86OYM9x">https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/average-cost-living-by-state/</a></span><span class="c1">. The data is number heavy, and not very expansive. I selected the dataset specifically to look at cost of rent vs income across the united states. There is a potential for bias in where the averages come from, but since the data is all collected in the same way, any variance from reality should be universal across the dataset. The relationship between the datapoints should be the same, so even if every number is skewed high, the relative distance between the two points should still be the same, allowing for an accurate ranking. There is no way to confirm this 100% though.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Discover</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first task that my prototype should perform is to rank the states from best to worst depending on a chosen filter. Why? So that the user can investigate comparisons between the options easily in order to inform a decision. How? The user can select one of the three categories, and the order of the states will change to reflect the best state in that category. What? This task seaks to learn what the most desirable state to live in is based on a specific category. Where? The task operates on a website, where the data that is displayed is drawn from the dataset depending on how the user selects a filter. When? During the investigation stage of moving to a new area.. Who? The user, specifically someone who wants to look at where they can afford to live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second task I want my prototype to do is to make a recommendation. The user should be able to enter a value for income, and receive a list of states that have a median income equal too or less than that entered value. The tool should also display the data for the average rent in those states. Why? So that the user can see areas where their income would be at or above average, so that they know they can afford to live there. How? The user enters a value, and receives a list of applicable states that meet the criteria. What? This task seeks to learn what states a particular income would be considered at or above average. Where? Also on the website. When? During the investigation stage of moving to a new area. Who? People who are looking to move and want to see where they could move that would be affordable.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Design</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This first sketch does not contain a graphical representation of the data. My initial idea centered on how to communicate the raw data in a digestible format. In my experience, it is essential to have numerical data available in its raw form, but presented in a digestible format. Looking at the prototype, I feel like I have created something that looks strikingly similar to the output of a mortgage calculator website. I like this design, but it is really the bare bones. I want to have a visual graph that reflects the same data. I think both forms can be useful. The interactive graph I created in assignment two could be a good decision to add in the next iteration. The reason I intend to keep the tables in the design is because when it comes to a ranking system, nothing is simpler than a list that starts with the best match, and descends to the worst. </span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 314.07px; height: 486.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 325.51px; height: 578.87px; margin-left: -11.44px; margin-top: -20.23px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Implement</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images below are a mock up of a much more astheticly pleasing output from the code &ldquo;CostOfLivingCSV.sort_values([input(&quot;Please select a colum:&quot;)],ascending=False)&rdquo; In python. In the final hypothetical website, I would code javascript to take a button click as the input, and the reordered table as the output. But that is outside the scope of the class. So I have created the final design, and also included the python output of the code that would power the tool. There is also a second page, where I would embed the interactive visualization that I made in assignment 2, with tooltips and everything, so that the same information that is presented in the tables would also be available in a visual format below. The tooltips help make the visualization readable, while the colors and axis labels help show the relationship between the variables. I created the mock up in Canva.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 264.00px; height: 360.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 313.00px; height: 406.00px; margin-left: -25.00px; margin-top: -14.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 291.00px; height: 321.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 300.00px; height: 389.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 588.50px; height: 274.44px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 588.50px; height: 274.44px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 209.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 209.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 551.50px; height: 283.70px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 551.50px; height: 283.70px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deploy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tasks that I outlined in step three are also visible in the visualizations above. I used an example income of $47,820 for the recommendation task, and I used &ldquo;Value of a dollar&rdquo; for the ranking task. The first observation that I made is that Mississippi has the highest value of a dollar. This means that living in Mississippi, you would have the highest purchasing power per dollar out of all the states. This is an interesting discovery because you can also see that Mississippi has a relatively low annual income. This is because there is an inverse relationship between income and purchasing power by state. The second thing I observed was that for the recommendation section, I didn&rsquo;t actually give the code any kind of ranking instructions, so the recommendations came out in alphabetical order. A future design change would be to give the user the option to order the recommendations the same way they can order the main dataset, by clicking on the column and having it sort by that column in descending order.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Iterate</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new task that I would like to add is to use the zillow api, which I have used in the past, to provide a recommended apartment in each recommended state that the tool provides. This is the &ldquo;next step&rdquo; in a workflow, where after the information gathering and investigation has been completed, we want to give our users an actionable next step, so that they will act on the new information they have. Otherwise, the time may have been wasted. I would do this on the website using calls to Zillows API based on the conditions the user specifies. It would be displayed using html and javascript as needed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reflect 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to my problem of finding what state I can rent in based on my income tells me that there are a lot of conditions that go into determining if this location is a good place to move. This tool is one part of the puzzle, but there are a lot more conditions that could be added. The problem is almost too complicated to solve with just one tool.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reflect 2</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1">The solution to my problem tells me that designing visualizations for the audience is very difficult. The issue I ran into once I was neck deep in the project was that representing numerical relationships visually can become very misleading and confusing for the user. As a data scientist, I was more than comfortable with the complex graphs that I could have used, but when I got down to it, I realized there was a reason that money related tools on banking sites show you financial information in a table. They don&rsquo;t want to confuse or mislead customers on accident, so they show them the numbers as numbers, not as colorful datapoints. That influenced my design choices, and I tried to take a realistic approach to the assignment. I wanted to create something that I could imagine presenting at an ideas meeting, where it was visually pleasing, but still realistically adoptable by an actual company. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Assignment is live at </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dylanherring.github.io/workflow.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1618006142205000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YgBjtb9YgRqOe8uinwFKp">https://dylanherring.github.io/workflow.html</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
