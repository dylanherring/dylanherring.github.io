			<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">The rich have always used their power and influence to advance themselves in life. Now, average people are starting to take notice. The events surrounding Reddit, Gamestop, and Hedge funds that took place at the end of January, 2021 have brought classism and corruption into the public’s eye, and they are not happy about it. Due to the unique state of the world we live in, the consequences of this event may be farther reaching than people realize. By being able to collectively assemble and share ideas nationwide, learn information about finance that historically has belonged to the elite, and act on that available information, all through the power of the internet, average people have cornered a group of wealthy elites, and are now locked in a classist standoff. The implications of this stand-off are that the wealth gap in America is not going unnoticed, and the people suffering are taking notice. Lawmakers have a choice to make about how they legislate this dispute between the wealthy elite, and the middle-lower class laymen.

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">Through the invention and popularization of the internet, online communities of like-minded individuals have thrived. Sites like Reddit, where people from all over the world can connect over a shared interest are especially popular. The average person, should they have an internet connection, has the potential for their ideas and opinions to reach thousands of real people on the other side of the screen. Historically, when enough people gather together around a shared belief, they are often spurred into action. In the modern age, people don’t have to gather together in person, they can gather together virtually, and still experience community, and still be spurred to action.The power of the internet doesn’t end with bringing people together around shared ideas and beliefs. It extends into everyday life, by influencing a person's access to information. One of the greatest methods of control that has been exhibited by those in power throughout human history, is the control of information. Decide what the people know, and you decide what they can think about, which controls what they do. The ability to Google whatever you want, coupled with freedom of information laws, allows people to educate themselves on anything they want. The narrative is no longer controlled by the elite. With the ability to access virtually any information, and educate yourself on any topic, as well as a platform that enhances the size of a community a person can interact with, has led to an unprecedented situation, where a large enough group of people acted synchronously to disrupt the status quo within the stock market. Now, regulators are taking notice and beginning to ask questions about the legality and morality of the situation.

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">The wealth inequality in America has risen dramatically since 1989, with the bottom 50% of American citizens accounting for around <1% of the total wealth in the country. The top 10% own >77%. When conceptualized in this way, it makes sense that those people on reddit jumped at an opportunity to bet against the hedge funds the way they did. Over the span of the coronavirus pandemic, people have lost loved ones, lost their jobs, been forced out of their apartments, had their homes foreclosed. Through it all, they have connected with others in similar situations via the internet. Updates on peoples struggles pop up on social media constantly. Over the same time period, Billionaires added considerably to their existing wealth. An average of 27% increase for billionaires world wide in fact. Some of that money has been taken out of the pockets of the mega-wealthy due to the GME short Squeeze that is taking place. Those wealthy people affected have started to call for consequences for the people involved, claiming that it was an organized attempt to manipulate the stock market. They want money from the government, and a change in regulation to control the actions taken by retail investors. In short, the wealthy are looking to change the rules so that they keep their money, reduce the risk they face, maintain their ability to influence the market, and keep the everyday american from being able to “catch up” using their same strategies.

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">Lawmakers have a choice in front of them. As our elected officials, they are meant to represent the interests of the American people, not the lobbyists, not the billionaires. The people are clamoring for an equal opportunity in the stock market. If they take the side of the citizens, and pass legislation against the interests of the hedge funds, they risk losing the campaign contributions that played a role in getting them elected in the first place. If they legislate against the people, and choose the side of money, they risk angering their constituents who will refuse to reelect them, regardless of funding. The added factor is historically, when there is an event that showcases the difference between the wealthy and the poor, there is a series of riots, protests, and even revolutions that follow. This factor is surely in the minds of politicians, and should be weighted heavily in the face of calls to “Eat the Rich” by people who feel they have nothing left to lose. 

<p class="tab" style="text-indent: 40px">The consequences of the Wallstreetbets GME stock squeeze are indeed much farther reaching and carry greater weight than people might initially think. Our people are more connected to each other than ever, yet at the same time more divided than ever in our history. The poor and middle class become harder to distinguish over time, and the rich prosper even in times of unprecedented crisis. Lawmakers are faced with a choice, the average citizens, or the elite citizens. For some lawmakers, the choice is unclear, because either option could lead to their removal from office the next time they must campaign. In the end, nobody saw it coming, and nobody knows where things are heading next.
